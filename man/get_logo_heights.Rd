\title{Get heights of logos in nlogomaker() under different scoring schemes}
\usage{
get_logo_heights(table, ic = FALSE, score = c("diff", "log", "log-odds",
  "probKL", "ratio", "unscaled_log", "wKL"), bg = NULL, pseudocount = NULL,
  opt = 1, symm = TRUE, alpha = 1, hist = FALSE, quant = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{table}{The input table (data frame or matrix) of compositional counts
or relative frequencies across different logos or symbols (specified along
the rows) for different sites or positions or groups
(specified along the columns).}

\item{ic}{Boolean, denoting whether information content based scaling is used
on top of the scoring scheme used or not. Default is FALSE}

\item{score}{Can take either of the options - \code{diff},
\code{log}, \code{log-odds}, \code{probKL}, \code{ratio}, 
\code{unscaled_log},
\code{wKL}. Each option corresponds to a different scoring scheme. The most}

\item{bg}{The background probability, which defaults to NULL, in which case
equal probability is assigned to each symbol. The user can however specify a
vector (equal to in length to the number of symbols) which specifies the
background probability for each symbol and assumes this background 
probability to be the same across the columns (sites), or a matrix, 
whose each cell specifies the background probability of the symbols 
for each position.}

\item{pseudocount}{A small pseudocount to be added mainly to bypass 0 entries. 
Default is NULL. If \code{table} is a counts matrix, 
the default changes to 0.5, if \code{table} is a 
positional weight matrix, the default becomes 0.001 times
the minimum non-zero value of the table.}

\item{opt}{Option parameter - taking values 1 and 2 - depending on whether
median adjustment is done based on background corrected proportions or 
without background correction.}

\item{symm}{A bool input, which if TRUE, the function uses symmetric KL 
divergence whereas if FALSE, the function uses non-symmetric KL divergence.}

\item{alpha}{The Renyi entropy tuning parameter which is used in case of
scaling of the bar heights by information criterion. The default tuning
parameter value is 1, which corresponds to Shannon entropy.}

\item{hist}{Whether to use the hist method or the information criterion
method to determine the heights of the logos.}

\item{quant}{The quantile to be adjusted for in computing enrichment and
depletion scores. Defaults to 0.5, which corresponds to the median.}
}
\value{
Returns the heights of enrichment and depletion for
diff approach to EDLogo.
}
\description{
Generates total heights of the stack of logos in the positive 
and negative
scales of the nlogomaker() logo plot along with the proportion of the height
distributed between the logos to be plotted in the positive and the negative
scales respectively under different scoring schemes.
