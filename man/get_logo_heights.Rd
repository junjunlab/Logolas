\usage{
get_logo_heights(
  table,
  ic = FALSE,
  score = c("diff", "log", "log-odds", "probKL", "ratio", "unscaled_log", "wKL",
    "preclog"),

}
\arguments{
\item{table}{The input table (data frame or matrix) of compositional counts
or relative frequencies across different logos or symbols (specified along
the rows) for different sites or positions or groups
(specified along the columns).}

\item{ic}{Boolean, denoting whether information content based scaling is used
on top of the scoring scheme used or not. Default is FALSE}

\item{score}{Can take either of the options - \code{diff},
\code{log}, \code{log-odds}, \code{probKL}, \code{ratio},
\code{unscaled_log},
\code{wKL}. Each option corresponds to a different scoring scheme. The most}

\item{llambda}{The log lambda matrix computed after stabilization step (if
used in \code{logomaker} function). Used for computing the
heights when not NULL.}

\item{bg}{The background probability, which defaults to NULL, in which case
equal probability is assigned to each symbol. The user can however specify a
vector (equal to in length to the number of symbols) which specifies the
background probability for each symbol and assumes this background
probability to be the same across the columns (sites), or a matrix,
whose each cell specifies the background probability of the symbols
for each position.}

\item{tol}{The tolerance for the KL-divergence of the positional weight
data and background probabilities.}

\item{opt}{Option parameter - taking values 1 and 2 - depending on whether
median adjustment is done based on background corrected proportions or
without background correction.}

\item{symm}{A bool input, which if TRUE, the function uses symmetric KL
divergence whereas if FALSE, the function uses non-symmetric KL divergence.}

\item{alpha}{The Renyi entropy tuning parameter which is used in case of
scaling of the bar heights by information criterion. The default tuning
parameter value is 1, which corresponds to Shannon entropy.}

\item{hist}{Whether to use the hist method or the information criterion
method to determine the heights of the logos.}

\item{quant}{The quantile to be adjusted for in computing enrichment and
depletion scores. Defaults to 0.5, which corresponds to the median.}

\item{quant_strategy}{Strategy used for quantile computation. For the default,
\code{quant_strategy = "center"}, the normal quantile is taken, which would
correspond to the middle point of the quantile interval. If
\code{quant_strategy = "lower"}, the lower limit of the quantile interval is
taken and if  \code{quant_strategy = "upper"}, the upper limit of the quantile
interval is considered.}
}
\value{
Returns the heights of enrichment and depletion for
diff approach to EDLogo.
}
\description{
Generates total heights of the stack of logos in the positive
and negative
scales of the nlogomaker() logo plot along with the proportion of the height
distributed between the logos to be plotted in the positive and the negative
scales respectively under different scoring schemes.
